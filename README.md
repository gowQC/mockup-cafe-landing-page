My first ever mockup of a landing page that I coordinated with a friend of mine (the "client"). It's a simple landing page that uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; no frameworks or libraries were included. The goal was to create a website for a new
cafe that contains all the basic elements any landing page should have: 
- a brand logo
- a suitable nav bar
- a footer that contains information displaying the address and Google Maps location, phone number, and social media pages
- an interactive menu that can calculate total cost and allow for online orders
- a gallery of the establishment along with pictures of the food served
- an "About Us" section of the establishment
- a news section dedicated to housing relevant stories regarding the cafe's communal impact onto an image slider on the page
